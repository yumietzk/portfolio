I am Yumie Tsuzuki, a self-taught front-end developer.<br />
After working as a system engineer for nearly 4 years, I realized my curiousity towards programming was growing bigger and decided to fully commit my time to teach myself programming to get a front-end developer job. I fell in love programming shortly after and made sure this was a right choice.<br />
I am hardworker, ambitious and coorporative. I always strive to learn more, improve my skills and try to communicate well with people to make things better.<br />
Please take a look at some personal projects below and get in touch with me!<br />
I look forward to getting a new opportunity ðŸ˜Š<br />
