I'm a self-taught front-end developer from Japan, currently based in Toronto, Canada.<br />
After working as a system engineer for nearly 4 years which I landed from a different background called international politics I majored in at university, I realized my curiosity and interest towards programming was growing and decided to fully commit my time to learn programming.<br />
I taught myself programming from scratch using some awesome Udemy courses, YouTube videos and tons of googling. I fell in love with programming quickly and I knew pursuing this passion was the right choice. I had ZERO knowledge about HTML and CSS, so I remember how excited I was when I first rendered "Hello World!" using HTML and designed with CSS.<br />
I'm a hardworker, ambitious and coorporative. I always strive to learn more, improve my skills and try to communicate well with people to make things better.<br />
Please take a look at my personal projects below and get in touch with me!<br />
I am looking forward to exploring new opportunities! ðŸ˜Š<br />
