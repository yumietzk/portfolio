I am Yumie Tsuzuki, a self-taught front-end developer from Japan, currently living in Toronto.

After working as a technical consultant for nearly 4 years, I realized my curious to programming was growing bigger and decided to fully commit my time to teach myself programming to get a front-end developer job. I fell in love programming shortly after and made sure this was a right choice.

I am hardworker, ambitious and coorporative. I always strive to learn more, improve my skills and try to communicate with people to make things better.

Please take a look at some personal projects below and get in touch with me!

I am hungry to get a new opportunity :)
