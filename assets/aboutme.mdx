I am Yumie Tsuzuki, a self-taught front-end developer.<br />
After working as a system engineer for nearly 4 years, I realized my curiosity and interest towards programming was growing and decided to fully commit my time to teach myself programming. I fell in love with programming quickly and I knew pursuing this passion was the right choice.<br />
I am a hardworker, ambitious and coorporative. I always strive to learn more, improve my skills and try to communicate well with people to make things better.<br />
Please take a look at my personal projects below and get in touch with me!<br />
I am looking forward to exploring new opportunities in programming ðŸ˜Š<br />
